# jsgenerator : Translating from Html to Js

# About

The goal is to generate Javascript  from HTML  following the JavaScript DOM structure.
Sometimes, we forget how to use javascript to build dynamic web apps. Thus, the goal of this project is helping developers gaining time by producing javascript code as output based on html as input. This project will be very useful for beginners learning html and javascript.

The project is based on [jsoup  library, a java html parser](https://jsoup.org/) / [Jsoup GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/) . It's all about using nodes to generate javascript. 

Actually, it's just a console program but gradually we will build a Maven/Gradle library then a web app translating from Html to Js, an app similar to Google Translate : https://translate.google.com/.
